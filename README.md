# Weather App

This is a simple Weather App made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows the current weather of any city you search for.

---

## What it shows now

When you search a city, it displays:

- Temperature
- Weather description
- Local time of the city

---

## What is missing

- 5-day weather forecast
- 5-hour hourly forecast

---

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter the city name.
3. Click search or press Enter.
4. See the current weather and local time.

---

## How it works

- Uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather info.
- Requires your own API key in the JavaScript file.

---

## Future improvements

- Add multi-day and hourly forecasts.
- Show more weather details like humidity and wind speed.
- Make the UI better and more interactive.
