# Weather App ☀️🌧️

This is a simple Weather App made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows the current weather of any city you search for.

---

## What it shows now 🔍

When you search a city, it displays:

- 🌡️ Temperature  
- ☁️ Weather description  
- 🕒 Local time of the city/country

---

## What is missing ❌

- 5-day weather forecast  
- 5-hour hourly forecast  

---

## How to use 🛠️

1. Enter the city name.  
2. Click search or press Enter.  
3. See the current weather and local time.  

---

## How it works ⚙️

- Uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather info.  
- Requires your own API key in the JavaScript file.  

---

## Future improvements 🚀

- Add 5-day and 5-hour forecasts (more days will be added later).  
- Show more weather details like humidity and wind speed.  
- Make the UI better and more interactive.
